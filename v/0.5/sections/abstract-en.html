<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Ontology of occupants behaviour inside a building, including environmental conditions and usersâ€™ interactions set the parameters for an accurate comfort behavioural profile. Towards this direction, the scope of this ontological model is to align environmental data with users preferences under a common framework in order to define a dynamically adaptive comfort profiling model in a building environment. Extensions to the base ontologies (BOT, SSN) apply in order to address the specific requirements for the model framework.
